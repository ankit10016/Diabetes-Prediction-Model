# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
• Created a machine learning algorithm model with features that accurately determine whether a person has diabetes using 100k+ datasets

• Employed various powerful libraries, including Seaborn, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, to visualize and preprocess the datasets

• Support Vector Machine with hyperplane optimization was used, and a machine learning approach was used to achieve high accuracy for the model

• Trained the SVM classifier with a degree of 3, catches size of 200 for faster processing, and tolerance of 0.001 for a more precise decision
